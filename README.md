# WASM-is-Awesome
My venture into Web Assembly

## What we will cover
* WAT (WebAssembly Text Format) about as close to WASM as you can get without downloading more RAM
* EmScripten and compiling higher level languages to WebAssembly
* Blazor and what WebAssembly means for the future of the web

## Main advantages
* Gives us a way to write code in languages we'd like (that aren't JS) that don't need to transpile to JS
* Support in all major browsers, it is an internet standard
* Performance
* Can call wasm modules from js and vice versa

## Disadvantages
* Tooling and docs seem sparse for the WAT format
* In order to use a language and compile it to WASM, you have to trust whoever built that compiler and may not reap the same optimizations
* Your favorite language might not have a compiler yet!
